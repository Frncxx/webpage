									<h3><a href="single.html">DOrSU employees trained to respond to emergencies

									<time class="published" datetime="2015-10-15">BY PIO · SEPTEMBER 18, 2022</time>
									<p>
										Selected staff and faculty of Davao Oriental State University
(DOrSU) received training from the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO), City of Mati, to prepare them for emergencies that might arise at work, at home, or in other locations requiring first aid.

The three-day training began on September 14, 2022. It was packed with practical exercises that could be performed in an emergency, including car accidents, cardiac arrest, drowning, fractures, musculoskeletal injuries, and problems breathing.

After performing all the first-aid training activities, the CDDRMO Mati Chapter also provided skills evaluation to assess participants’ understanding of the activities and how they are correctly conducted and performed.

Ms. Karen Marie A. Bacalso, CDRRMO-Mati Emergency Medical Services Chief, said, “the training is a life skill that, if performed correctly, will surely save lives.” She emphasized that first-aid training aims to prevent further injury, preserve life, alleviate suffering, and promote recovery.

DOrSU President Dr. Roy G. Ponce, on the other hand, remarked that this training is timely, especially for the upcoming MASTS Games 2022 on November 6 to 11, 2022. (DOrSU PIO)

									<h3><a href="single.html">US Pediatricians, DOrSU work toward reducing maternal, newborn mortality
										</a></h3>
									<time class="published" datetime="2015-10-10">BY PIO · SEPTEMBER 14, 2022</time>
									<p>
										Pediatricians from Johns Hopkins University and the Institute of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences (INAHS) conducted a two-day training from September 13 to 14, 2022, at the university library for midwives, nurses, and nursing students in Davao Oriental to reduce maternal and newborn mortality.

“With the rising mortality rate of mothers and babies during birth, this training will capacitate participants to assist mothers in giving birth, especially the mothers who are experiencing Hemorrhage and babies who are experiencing Asphyxia. Asphyxia means the difficulty of breathing brought about by the lack or insufficiency of oxygen in the brain, which sometimes leads to death,” Pediatric Doctor Nicole Shilkofski said.

Dr. Shilkofski also emphasized that mothers should take care of themselves during pregnancy, such as being conscious of their nutrition, as it affects the mother and the baby.

After their first day of training, Dr. Shilkofski and her co-delegates met with DOrSU President Dr. Roy G. Ponce. They discussed collecting baseline data on the mortality statistics targeted in Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) and Helping Mothers Survive (HMS) programs.
